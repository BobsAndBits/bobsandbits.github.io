# Uno Houserule: No-skip On Power

The [official Uno rules](https://www.unorules.com/) dictate that, _when a player plays a power card, the next player has to skip a turn_. However, we override this rule with the following houserule -

> When a player plays a power card other than the "skip" (ðŸš«) card, the next player does NOT have to skip their turn. They will face the rest of the consequences of the previously played power card, and then will play their own card.

## Explanation by example

When applicable -

1. Bob plays a "+2" card.
2. Alice picks up 2 cards from deck.
3. Alice plays a card from her hand.

When not applicable -

1. Bob plays a "skip".
2. Alice is skipped.

## Reasoning

This allows for a more dynamic play where even if one player has a large number of power cards, the immediate next player is not _starved_ of their turns.

## Note

1. This does not alter the _stackability_ of the cards. Officially, Uno cards are not stackable.
