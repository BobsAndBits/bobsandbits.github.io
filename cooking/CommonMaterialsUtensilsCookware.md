# Common Materials Used to Make Utensils and Cookware (WIP)

## Summaries & Rankings

### Cooking tier list

1. Cast Iron (Safe, easy to clean)
2.

### Utensils tier list

Tier 1: Excellent
- Kansa (Unless eating/drinking acidic food/beverage)
- Glass (For everything)

Tier 2: Pretty good
- Copper (Same as Kansa)
- SS (Gets the job done)

Tier 3: Would avoid
- Aluminum
- Melamine

Tier 4: Abysmal

## Individual Profiles

### Copper

Bengali: তামা, তাম্র <br />

- Pure copper is hardly used nowadays
- Kansa is a better alternative
- Pretty good for utensils
- Not great for cooking since might react with acids and iodine

### Brass

Bengali: পিতল <br />

- Not great for cooking since might react with acids and iodine
- May secretly contain upto 2% Lead (Pb)

### Bronze

Bengali: ব্রোঞ্জ <br />
Formulation: Mixing Copper with Tin (12%-15%) <br />

- Not great for cooking since might react with acids and iodine

### Kansa

Aliases: Bell Metal, Bell Bronze, Indian Bronze, Kanchu <br />
Bengali: কাঁসা <br />
Formulation: Copper 78% and Tin% <br />

- Great for utensils
- Keeps water tasty
- Decent for cooking but avoid sour/acidic.
- Easier to maintain than other copper based alloys.

### Stainless steel, SS

- Very safe for cooking since doesn't react much
- Takes time to heat up. But can have copper plates attached to the bottom to mitigate
- The most preferred type will be stamped "18/10"

### Cast Iron

Bengali: লোহা, ঢালাই লোহা

- Slow to heat up. But otherwise great for cooking.
- Needs to be greased up properly.
- Very easy to clean.

### Aluminum

- Not great for cooking, since is somewhat reactive.
- Easily flakes off into food and potentially harm the body.

### Carbon Steel

- Not great for cooking.

### Enameled Cast Iron / Coated Cast Iron / Ceramic Coated Aluminium

- The coating can rub off eventually, potentially exposing the bonding glue.

### Nonstick / Teflon

- Often contain toxic chemicals.
- Eventually degrades and exposes harmful bonding glue.

### Glass

- Excellent for utensils.
- Extremely non-reactive
- Difficult to cook with without specialized ovens.

### Silver

### Ceramic / Porcelain

### Melamine
