## Individual Profiles

### Copper

Bengali: তামা, তাম্র <br />

- Pure copper is hardly used nowadays.
- Kansa is a better alternative.
- Pretty good for utensils.
- Not great for cooking since might react with acids and iodine.

### Brass

Bengali: পিতল <br />

- Not great for cooking since might react with acids and iodine.
- May secretly contain upto 2% Lead (Pb).

### Bronze

Bengali: ব্রোঞ্জ <br />
Formulation: Mixing Copper with Tin (12%-15%) <br />

- Not great for cooking since might react with acids and iodine.

### Kansa

Aliases: Bell Metal, Bell Bronze, Indian Bronze, Kanchu <br />
Bengali: কাঁসা <br />
Formulation: Copper 78% and Tin% <br />

- Great for utensils.
- Keeps water tasty.
- Decent for cooking but avoid sour/acidic.
- Easier to maintain than other copper based alloys.

### Stainless steel, SS

- Very safe for cooking since doesn't react much.
- Takes time to heat up. But can have copper plates attached to the bottom to mitigate.
- The most preferred type will be stamped "18/10".

### Cast Iron

Bengali: লোহা, ঢালাই লোহা

- Slow to heat up. But otherwise great for cooking.
- Needs to be greased up properly.
- Very easy to clean.

### Silver

- Silver is actually safe to consume.
- May react with some food such as eggs.
- Rather good as utensils.
- High maintenance as a cookware.

### Aluminium

- Not great for cooking, since is somewhat reactive.
- Easily flakes off into food and potentially harm the body.
- Aluminium is a neurotoxic metal.

### Anodized Aluminium

- Better than regular aluminium as these are acid treated.

### Carbon Steel

- Not great for cooking.

### Enameled Cast Iron / Coated Cast Iron / Ceramic Coated Aluminium

- The coating can rub off eventually, potentially exposing the bonding glue.

### Ceramic

- Pure ceramic utensils is hard to come by.
- Ceramic, while better than teflon, isn't completely safe. Often contain heavy metals.

### Nonstick / Teflon

- Often contain toxic chemicals.
- Eventually degrades and exposes harmful bonding glue.

### Glassclay

- Excellent for utensils.
- Extremely non-reactive.
- Difficult to cook with without specialized ovens.

### Porcelain

- Great for utensils.
- Coloring may contain harmful chemicals.

### Melamine

- Is a type of plastic.
- Rather unsafe, especially for anything hot.

### Plastic

- Every kind of plastic is different. However, even so called food-grade plastic and even microwave-safe plastics aren't guaranteed to be safe.
- Recommended to avoid at all situations (unless compared so situationally worse combinations. i.e. highly sour food with copper).

### Wood

- Type of wood matters. However, in general, pretty good and safe for utensils.
- Naturally, not recommended as cookware.

### Clay

- Quality of the clay matters. In general, good quality clay is safe for utensils and even cookware.
- Colors mixed into the clay (or painted on top) can be harmful.
